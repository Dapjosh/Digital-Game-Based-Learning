        SudoBra is a game that integrates sudoku puzzle with mathematics implemented as part of a digital game based learning
        research project. The game is grouped into three levels where the first level(easy) provides just a 4 x 4 sudoku grid with lesser questions, the
        second level(medium) provides a 8 x 8 grid with less questions than the first and the third(difficult) sets more question with a 9 x 9 grid.

        In the equation you are required to solve for x. The equation is in the form ax+b=c or ax-b=c, In solving equations with
        + sign you move the b to the c making it c-b and then divide your answer by a and that gives your solution. In an equation with the negative operation,
        you move b to c and this makes it to be c + b, then divide your answer by a to arrive at the required solution.
